## Architecture Overview

### System Design Philosophy

The Ask AI feature is built on three core principles:

1. **Contextual Relevance**: Every AI response is grounded in actual dataset content
2. **Performance Efficiency**: Intelligent sampling ensures fast responses without sacrificing accuracy
3. **Scalable Analysis**: Support for both single and multi-dataset queries

### Technology Stack

- **AI Engine**: OpenAI GPT-4o for natural language processing and insight generation
- **Data Processing**: Node.js with TypeScript for backend data handling
- **Storage**: AWS S3 for dataset storage, PostgreSQL for metadata
- **Frontend**: React with Chart.js for visualization rendering

## Context Engineering Components

### 1. Dataset Metadata Integration

**Purpose**: Provide AI with comprehensive dataset understanding before analysis

**Implementation**:
- Automatic extraction of dataset structure, column types, and statistical summaries
- Integration of custom YAML metadata for business context
- Real-time size and format detection for sampling strategy selection

**Context Data Included**:
```
- Dataset name and source location
- File size and format information
- Column names and data types
- Statistical summaries (min, max, mean, null counts)
- Business metadata from YAML files
- Historical usage patterns
```

### 2. Intelligent Sampling Framework

**Purpose**: Create representative data samples that maintain statistical integrity while enabling fast AI processing

**Sampling Strategies**:

| Strategy | Size Limit | Sample Rows | Use Case |
|----------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| Representative | 50MB | 5,000 | Large datasets requiring statistical accuracy |
| Comprehensive | 20MB | 2,000 | Medium datasets with complex patterns |
| Focused | 10MB | 1,000 | Targeted analysis scenarios |
| Balanced | 8MB | 750 | Multi-dataset analysis |
| Lightweight | 5MB | 500 | Quick insights and performance-critical queries |

**Sample Selection Logic**:
- Stratified random sampling for categorical variables
- Edge case inclusion for outlier detection
- Temporal sampling for time-series data
- Geographic distribution preservation for location-based datasets

### 3. Question Context Analysis

**Purpose**: Tailor data retrieval and sampling based on user query intent

**Query Classification**:
- **Statistical Queries**: "What's the average income by state?"
- **Pattern Discovery**: "Show trends in health outcomes over time"
- **Comparative Analysis**: "Compare education levels between counties"
- **Anomaly Detection**: "Find unusual patterns in this data"

**Context Adaptation**:
- Query-specific column selection for targeted sampling
- Time-range filtering for temporal queries
- Geographic filtering for location-based analysis
- Cross-dataset relationship identification

## RAG Implementation

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework

**Core Components**:

1. **Query Extraction**: Natural language processing to identify data requirements
2. **Filter Construction**: Automatic generation of data filters based on query context
3. **Progressive Scanning**: Intelligent data retrieval for complex queries
4. **Context Assembly**: Combination of metadata, samples, and query context

### Query Processing Pipeline

```
User Question → Query Analysis → Filter Generation → Data Retrieval → Context Assembly → AI Processing → Response Generation
```

**Query Analysis Engine**:
- Extracts entities (states, counties, time periods)
- Identifies required data columns
- Determines aggregation requirements
- Classifies visualization needs

**Filter Construction**:
- State/county geographic filters
- Date range temporal filters
- Category-based subset filters
- Value range numerical filters

### Progressive Scanning Technology

**When Activated**:
- Queries requiring comprehensive dataset coverage
- Complex analytical requirements
- Cross-dataset relationship analysis

**Process**:
1. Initial metadata-based assessment
2. Incremental data chunk processing
3. Real-time result aggregation
4. Adaptive sample size adjustment

## Multi-Dataset Context Management

### Cross-Dataset Analysis Framework

**Context Aggregation Strategy**:
- Parallel processing of individual dataset contexts
- Schema alignment for comparable data structures
- Intelligent relationship mapping between datasets
- Unified response generation

### Performance Optimization for Multiple Datasets

**Lightweight Sampling Approach**:
- Reduced sample size per dataset (500 rows vs 2000+)
- Parallel dataset processing
- Optimized memory usage
- Fast response generation

**Context Synthesis**:
```
Dataset A Context + Dataset B Context + ... → Unified Analysis Context → AI Processing → Comparative Insights
```

### Relationship Discovery

**Automatic Detection**:
- Common column identification (counties, states, years)
- Data type compatibility analysis
- Value range overlap assessment
- Temporal alignment opportunities

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy

**Multi-Level Caching**:
1. **Metadata Cache**: Dataset structure and statistics
2. **Sample Cache**: Pre-computed representative samples
3. **Context Cache**: Processed context objects
4. **Response Cache**: Frequently requested insights

### Response Time Targets

| Query Type | Target Response Time | Optimization Strategy |
|------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Simple Statistics | < 5 seconds | Cached metadata analysis |
| Single Dataset Analysis | < 15 seconds | Intelligent sampling |
| Multi-Dataset Comparison | < 30 seconds | Parallel processing + lightweight sampling |
| Complex RAG Queries | < 45 seconds | Progressive scanning + caching |

### Memory Management
