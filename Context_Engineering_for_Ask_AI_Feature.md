# Context Engineering for Ask AI Feature

## Overview

The Ask AI feature in Data Lake Explorer uses advanced context engineering to provide intelligent insights and analysis of your datasets. This document explains how the AI system works, how to craft effective questions, and best practices for getting the most valuable responses.

## How Ask AI Works

### 1. Context Preparation
When you use the Ask AI feature, the system automatically:

- **Dataset Analysis**: Examines the structure, columns, data types, and sample data from your selected dataset
- **Metadata Extraction**: Gathers information about file size, format, source, and any available tags
- **Schema Understanding**: Creates a comprehensive understanding of your data's structure and relationships
- **Statistical Summary**: Generates basic statistics about numerical columns and categorical distributions

### 2. Intelligent Sampling
For large datasets, the AI uses smart sampling techniques:

- **Representative Sampling**: Selects representative rows that capture the diversity of your data
- **Column Prioritization**: Focuses on the most informative columns first
- **Size Optimization**: Ensures the context fits within AI model limits while maintaining data integrity
- **Quality Filtering**: Removes incomplete or corrupted rows from the sample

### 3. Context Construction
The AI builds a rich context that includes:

```
Dataset: [Your Dataset Name]
Format: [CSV/JSON/etc.]
Size: [Row count and file size]
Structure: [Column names and types]
Sample Data: [Representative rows]
Metadata: [Tags, source information]
Statistical Summary: [Key metrics and distributions]
```

## Effective Question Strategies

### 1. Descriptive Questions
Ask about what the data contains and represents:

**Good Examples:**
- "What does this dataset tell us about population demographics?"
- "Describe the main patterns in this healthcare data"
- "What are the key variables and their relationships?"

**Why This Works:**
- Leverages the AI's ability to synthesize information
- Provides comprehensive overviews
- Helps identify important trends and patterns

### 2. Analytical Questions
Request specific analysis or calculations:

**Good Examples:**
- "What are the correlations between income and education levels?"
- "Which counties have the highest rates of diabetes?"
- "How does air quality vary across different regions?"

**Why This Works:**
- Utilizes the AI's analytical capabilities
- Provides quantitative insights
- Identifies statistical relationships

### 3. Comparative Questions
Ask about differences and comparisons:

**Good Examples:**
- "How do urban areas compare to rural areas in this dataset?"
- "What are the differences between states in the top and bottom quartiles?"
- "Which time periods show the most significant changes?"

**Why This Works:**
- Highlights important contrasts
- Reveals relative performance
- Identifies outliers and anomalies

### 4. Predictive and Trend Questions
Explore patterns and potential outcomes:

**Good Examples:**
- "What trends can you identify in this time series data?"
- "Are there any seasonal patterns in this dataset?"
- "What factors seem to predict higher outcomes?"

**Why This Works:**
- Uncovers temporal patterns
- Identifies predictive relationships
- Provides forward-looking insights

## Question Crafting Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific and Clear
**Instead of:** "What's interesting about this data?"
**Try:** "What are the top 3 factors associated with higher life expectancy in this health dataset?"

### 2. Provide Context When Needed
**Instead of:** "Why are these numbers high?"
**Try:** "Why might the poverty rates be higher in these specific counties compared to the state average?"

### 3. Ask Follow-up Questions
**Initial:** "What are the main demographic patterns?"
**Follow-up:** "How do these demographic patterns relate to economic indicators?"

### 4. Request Specific Formats
- "Provide a summary in bullet points"
- "List the top 5 findings with supporting data"
- "Create a narrative explanation of the trends"

## Types of Insights You Can Expect

### 1. Descriptive Analytics
- Data quality assessment
- Distribution descriptions
- Summary statistics
- Missing value analysis

### 2. Diagnostic Analytics
- Correlation analysis
- Outlier identification
- Pattern recognition
- Anomaly detection

### 3. Comparative Analytics
- Regional comparisons
- Temporal analysis
- Demographic breakdowns
- Performance rankings

### 4. Predictive Insights
- Trend identification
- Risk factor analysis
- Forecasting patterns
- Relationship modeling

## Multi-Dataset Chat Feature

When using the multi-dataset chat feature, the AI can:

### Cross-Dataset Analysis
- Compare metrics across different datasets
- Identify common patterns and themes
- Merge insights from related data sources
- Provide comprehensive multi-source analysis

### Best Practices for Multi-Dataset Queries:
1. **Specify Datasets**: "Compare poverty rates from the Census data with health outcomes from the CDC data"
2. **Request Connections**: "How do the environmental factors relate to the health indicators across these datasets?"
3. **Ask for Synthesis**: "What overall story do these three datasets tell about rural communities?"

## Understanding AI Limitations

### What the AI Can Do:
- Analyze patterns and trends in your data
- Provide statistical insights and summaries
- Identify correlations and relationships
- Generate hypotheses about your data
- Explain complex data in simple terms

### What the AI Cannot Do:
- Access data outside of what you've provided
- Make definitive causal claims without proper study design
- Provide personal or sensitive information
- Replace domain expertise and critical thinking
- Guarantee 100% accuracy in all interpretations

## Optimizing Your AI Interactions

### 1. Start Broad, Then Narrow
1. Begin with general questions to understand the dataset
2. Ask more specific questions based on initial insights
3. Dive deep into areas of particular interest

### 2. Iterate and Refine
- Build on previous responses
- Ask for clarification when needed
- Request additional details on interesting findings

### 3. Combine Technical and Business Questions
- "What's the technical correlation between these variables?"
- "What does this mean for policy decisions?"
- "How can this insight be applied practically?"

## Privacy and Security

### Data Handling
- Only the data you select is analyzed
- No data is stored permanently by the AI system
- Analysis occurs in real-time and context is not retained between sessions
- Your folder access permissions are respected

### Best Practices
- Review AI responses for accuracy
- Validate insights with domain knowledge
- Use AI as a starting point for deeper analysis
- Maintain awareness of data sensitivity levels
