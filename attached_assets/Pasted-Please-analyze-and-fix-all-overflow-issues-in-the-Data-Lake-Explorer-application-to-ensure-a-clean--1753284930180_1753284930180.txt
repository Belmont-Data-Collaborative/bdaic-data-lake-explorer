Please analyze and fix all overflow issues in the Data Lake Explorer application to ensure a clean, responsive UI without any horizontal or vertical overflow. Focus on these key areas:

1. **Main Layout & Container Management**:
   - Ensure the main layout uses proper viewport units and doesn't exceed screen boundaries
   - Fix any container widths that might cause horizontal scrolling
   - Implement proper responsive breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop

2. **Dataset Chat Modal** (`client/src/components/dataset-chat.tsx`):
   - Ensure the modal doesn't overflow viewport height on small screens
   - Fix chart rendering container to prevent horizontal overflow
   - Make the chat message area properly scrollable without affecting the overall layout
   - Ensure long dataset names and messages wrap properly

3. **Dataset and Folder Cards**:
   - Prevent card content from overflowing containers
   - Ensure long dataset names, descriptions, and metadata wrap appropriately
   - Fix any badge or label overflow issues
   - Make card grids responsive without horizontal scrolling

4. **Tables and Data Display**:
   - Implement proper table responsiveness with horizontal scrolling only when necessary

5. **Navigation and Headers**:
   - Ensure header elements don't overflow on smaller screens

   - Ensure Chart.js charts are responsive and contained
   - Fix any chart legend or tooltip overflow issues
